@501 = ~Hello <LADYLORD>. My name is: Gilbertus Agumanus, handyman savant, and I have a UNIQUE offer for you: do you see the beautiful half-mechanical spider by my side *he points to the steel spider*? It would be a superb reinforcement for your group: it can withstand anything, is virtually invulnerable, will follow you everywhere and will unfailingly rip your enemies to shreds.~
@502 = ~Okay, how much is it?~ // 508
@503 = ~Half-mechanical, no less... And where do the superpowers of this... thingy come from?~ // 526
@504 = ~No thanks, I don't need a mechanical watchdog.~ // EXIT 

@505 = ~This machine reminds me of something my great-uncle Hildebrand Jansen built. On a trip through the forests of Tethyr, he came across a giant ant farm and narrowly escaped them because he was a good tree climber, but on his way home he had the idea of building a giant mechanical ant that looked a bit like this gentleman's spider, only better. Problems arose when he wanted to build several of them as escorts, and they started attacking each other. He was close to finding a solution and had already received a generous offer from the captain of the constable's guard, but that's when he found himself unjustly mixed up in a traffic in giant turnips and preferred to flee the region. After that, he completely changed his ways and ended up in Calimport, but uh... All right, all right, I'll tell you the rest some other time.~

@506 = ~I have little confidence in this kind of "machine", <CHARNAME>. It's so far removed from Nature's teachings, I really don't know what good it could do us. But do as you wish, I'll respect your choice.~

@507 = ~Bah. The real giant spiders of the Underdark are certainly far more formidable than this... ersatz. But if you're stupid enough to throw your gold away, buy the spider from this yingil.~

@508 = ~80,000 gold coins. Don't let that put you off, I guarantee she's well worth the investment. Did I forget to mention that I've made her magic-sensitive, so your spells can affect her? And what's more, I've fitted it with a potion compartment, into which you can pour any potions you like: they'll transmit their magical power to it!~ // 509 510 511 512
@509 = ~I see. Okay, I'll take it.~ // DEAL 532
@510 = ~That's a lot of money. I'm interested, but I'd need a small discount. How about 70,000?~ // 513 514
@511 = ~Not bad, but too expensive for what it is. I'll take it at 60,000, no more.~ // 517 518 
@512 = ~80000 ?! It's too expensive for an amateur DIY. No thanks, find a pigeon, there are plenty here.~//EXIT

@513 = ~Well... All right, then. But you're getting a hell of a bargain.~ // DEAL 532
@514 = ~Ah no <LADYLORD>, 80000 is already a bargain price for this fantastic construction. 80000, you won't regret it.~ // 515 516
@515 = ~Well... All right, then.~ // DEAL
@516 = ~Well... I don't think that's going to be possible. Find another buyer.~ // EXIT

@517 = ~Well... All right, then. I don't even know why I'm giving it to you at this price. You're getting the deal of the century, I guarantee it.~ // DEAL 532
@518 = ~Ah no <LADYLORD>, 80000 is already a bargain price for this fantastic construction. 80000, you won't regret it.~ // 519 520 521 522
@519 = ~Well... All right, then.~ // DEAL 532
@520 = ~OK, I'm interested, but a little effort anyway! 75,000 and we're in business?~ // 523 524
@521 = ~Pffff... I don't mind going up to 65,000, but no more. I don't even know if this thing works, by the way...~ // 525
@522 = ~I'm sorry, I can't put such a large sum of money into this machine. Goodbye.~ // EXIT
@523 = ~Well... All right, then. I guess it's still a good deal.~ // DEAL 532
@524 =  ~Ah no <LADYLORD>, I'm sure I'll find a customer who will recognize and accept this exceptional offer. Good-bye.~ //EXIT
@525 = ~Why are we still talking if you have so little faith in my machine? I'm sure I can find a buyer in this town who is genuinely interested. Good-bye.~ //EXIT


@526 = ~In fact, it's not 100% mechanical. A true mechanical construction would resist magic: the trick is that I've made it magic-sensitive, so that it can benefit from any spells you might cast on it. And also so that it can consume potions, thanks to the clever potion compartment I've equipped it with. So, for the modest price of 80,000 gold coins, do you want it?~ // 509 527 528 529
@527 = ~It all looks very impressive... But it's a little too expensive for my finances. Listen, how about a little discount? I'm willing to pay 70,000 gold coins.~ // 513 514
@528 = ~Well... Its paws don't look any sharper than a good sword, and I'm afraid it won't stand up to the battles I'll have to wage one day against my formidable enemies. I value it at 55,000 gold pieces, so here's my proposal.~ // 530 531 
@529 = ~80,000 gold coins? Modest? You have a strange conception of the word "modest". I'm afraid I can't.~ // EXIT
@530 = ~Well... All right, then. I don't even know why I'm giving it to you at this price. You're getting the deal of the century, I guarantee it.~ // DEAL
@531 = ~How? Your proposal is almost insulting! I don't even want to discuss it, I'll find a customer who appreciates my creation. Good-bye.~ // EXIT

//DEAL
@532 = ~All right, then. Listen carefully to these command words, and repeat them in front of the spider: it will then put itself at your service. *he states a series of unconnected but easy-to-remember words*.~ // 533 534
@533 = ~Okay, thanks.~ // 561 FIN
@534 = ~By the way, tell me, what's that other black spider behind you?~ // 535
@535 = ~Ah, this one? Oh, uh... this one's my bodyguard, sort of. It's best to be careful, I've heard that some of the neighborhoods here are pretty dodgy. Besides, thieves' guilds are active here, if you know what I mean...~ // 536 537 538
@536 = ~You're right, this town isn't safe. Goodbye.~ // EXIT
@537 = ~But this black spider looks much better finished than the other one, you wouldn't happen to be selling it, would you?~ // 539 
@538 = ~It's made of obsidian, it seems. I've heard that obsidian is an excellent receptacle for magical enchantments. Tell me more...~ // 551

@539 = ~Ah uh... no, it's just that I built the steel one first, and then I had to keep one for protection. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go.~ // 540 541 542 543
@540 = ~Wait, I'll take it for 100,000 gold coins!~ // 544
@541 = ~Wait, I'll take it for 200,000 gold coins!~ // 545 546
@542 = ~Wait, I'll take it for 300,000 gold coins!~ // 549 550
@543 = ~Wait, I'll take it for 400,000 gold coins!~ // 559
@544 = ~HA HA HA, are you kidding?! It cost me more than that in materials and enchantments alone! I don't have time for jokes like that, goodbye!~ FIN
@545 = ~No, it was very expensive to make and develop, and as I said, I need it to protect myself. Goodbye.~ //FIN 
@546 = ~No, it cost me a lot of money to make, and I couldn't sell it at that price...~ // 547 548
@547 = ~I understand, I'm willing to pay 300,000 gold pieces. ~ // 549 550
@548 = ~It looks so powerful... I'll buy it from you for 400,000 gold pieces.~ // 559
@549 = ~It's a nice offer but... no, I really need it. Sorry, I really have to go. Goodbye and have a nice trip!~ //FIN
@550 = ~You've convinced me... I'm willing to give it to you at this price, but only because it's you. It will protect you without fail, I guarantee it!~ // 560

@551 = ~Oh, do you know anything about alchemy and the arcane?~ // 552
@552 = ~A little bit, I spent my childhood in a huge library after all. I know that obsidian prevents lightning damage that could be caused to a metal spider. I also know that obsidian, a volcanic stone, is totally resistant to fire. What's more, the legs of this spider are unquestionably sharper than those of the other.~// 553
@553 = ~You know more about this than I could have imagined when I first saw you. You're right, and what's more, its damage regeneration is better than that of the steel spider. Obsidian's pure crystallinity also gives it better vision, unaffected by any spells. Yes, a clear improvement on the other, I must say.~ // 554 555
@554 = ~And I could do with a bodyguard like that, given the formidable adversaries in my path. I'll buy him from you for 300,000 gold coins.~ // 549 550
@555 = ~Fantastic! But the downside of this machine is that it's going to be the envy of many. Other people more knowledgeable and less honest than me are likely to spot it very quickly, and there may already be some close by... I'll take her for 250,000 gold pieces right now. But don't procrastinate, I have to leave quickly.~ // 556 557
@556 = ~No, it's really too little, I'd rather take the risk, I have every confidence in this spider to defend me. Have a nice trip!~ //FIN
@557 = ~So few... But maybe you're right, some of the people we meet here do seem so... worrying. And with that amount of money, I should be able to build another one. Okay, you've convinced me, the deal's done.~ // 558
@558 = ~I am delighted!~ // 560

//DEAL2 REUSSI
@559 = ~At that price... I can only concede, it's enough to hire a whole troop of mercenaries by the year and make a new obsidian spider. The deal's done!~ // 560 
@560 = ~*Gilbertus Agumanus then teaches you a new series of command words, which you carefully memorize. He then takes his leave, quickly disappearing around a corner.*~ // 533
@561 = ~Well, too bad. Farewell.~
@562 = ~Hello <LADYLORD>. Ho... Next!~
@563 = ~Wait! I've come back with 80,000 gold coins. I want to buy your semi-mechanical spider.~
