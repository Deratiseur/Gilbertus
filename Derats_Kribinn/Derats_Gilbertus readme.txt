Gilbertus Agumanus is a tinker gnome you can find on the Waukyne promenade or at kuldahar, accompanied by two semi-mechanical spiders. The black one is his bodyguard, and the gray one is for sale, and if you buy it, that's where it all begins:
- The semi-mechanical spider can follow you everywhere, like a 7th companion.
- Its stats are those of a 10 DV monster, CA 4, fire resistance 50%, electricity vulnerability 25%, magic vulnerability 25%, immune to non-magical weapons, immune to poison, disease, level drain, death effects and mental effects.
- It can attacks 2 times per round for 1D8 slashing damage per blow. These paws are not magic.
- It regenerates 1 point of life per turn.
- It is invulnerable: if it falls below 3 hit points, it goes into "rest" mode, during which it shows a red back, is ignored by the AI, is inactive, untargetable and regenerates faster for 6 rounds. It restarts automatically after 6 rounds with 5 hit points. 
- Each time it suffers lighning damage, it must save against death with at +2. If it fails, it is destroyed in an explosion that inflicts 10D6 points of fire damage (save for 1/2) over 10 meters (the inventions of tinker gnomes often end up causing their death^^).
- It incorporates a compartment into which you can pour any potion from the game (or from the L'Interplan and Jan's Alchemy mods) that will have an effect on the spider. The compartment is then locked (you can't pour anything else into it) for half the potion's normal duration. And yes, you can cumulate several potions if you play with the durations.
- Some potions do not lock the compartment: Healing potions (all forms), Invisibility potion, Disenchantment potion.
- Some potions are not offered because they are useless: Potion against poison/disease/mental aggression, potions boosting wisdom or intelligence, potions improving thieves' or magicians' skills, etc...

Many thanks to Le marquis, without whom this mod would be less substantial (he wrote all the Gilbertus dialogue).
